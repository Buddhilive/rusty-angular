# RustyAngular

Welcome to your Angular project that uses Rust with WebAssembly! This project demonstrates how to use Rust and WebAssembly to create high-performance Angular applications.

Rust is a programming language that is known for its speed and safety. WebAssembly is a binary format that can be executed in the browser. By using Rust and WebAssembly together, you can create Angular applications that are both fast and secure.

## Development server

Run `npm run serve:dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build:prod` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
